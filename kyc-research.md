| **Speed vs. Accuracy**                  | - Offers a *balanced* approach between speed and accuracy. The verification process, especially with video capture, may take slightly longer than pure AI-driven processes, but the hybrid approach of AI and human review ensures better fraud detection and accuracy <br/> - For users, the video process may take *a few extra seconds* compared to just snapping a photo, but the added security is worthwhile for high-risk industries.  | - Optimized for speed (*fast*). Verifications are typically faster since Onfido relies heavily on AI-driven decisions, particularly for straightforward KYC processes like document matching and biometric checks.<br/> - Can struggle slightly in complex cases or low-quality images, where accuracy may dip compared to a human-reviewed process.                 | - Slightly slower (due to human review *but more accurate results*) <br/> - Focuses on accuracy, especially in industries where fraud prevention is critical. Jumio’s hybrid of AI and human review results in slightly slower verifications but with fewer errors, making it ideal for sectors like banking and cryptocurrency|
